Do:
Sweet potato in with the tomatoes (cooked first), tasty but maybe better with non sweet potatoes that might crisp up a bit differently? And add a crunchy texture?

Mint as garnish, so freaking tasty in there.

Unnoticeable/Meh:
Avocado as a garnish, can't even taste it. Maybe more feta instead? It was nice with the feta when I mixed them up to add, but the flavour was overwhelmed by everything else. Maybe slices next time?

Buen apetito!
