recipe:
  person: Helena
  servings: 2 people
  prep: 10 minutes
  cook: 10 minutes
  ingredients:
  - 1 egg
  - 1 large carrot (winterpeen)
  - about the same amount of cabbage
  - 1el 고추장 (gochujang)
  - small handful cheddar
  - 1tl suiker
  - 4 slices white bread (OR 2 Pita)
  - butter
  - Sriracha
  - Mayo (kewpie?)

  directions: |
    1. Shred the carrot, finely chop the cabbage
    1. In a bowl mix the egg and 고추장 (gochujang)
    1. Combine, mix.
    1. Cook over medium-high heat
    1. Once almost done cooking, dust with the sugar + cheddar and it should melt.
    1. Toast the bread (one side covered in butter) in a pan so it gets nice and crispy. (Toaster the faster alternative)
    1. Place the egg/carrot/cabbage/cheese mixture on one slice of bread
    1. Draw pretty lines of mayo and sriracha to cover it.
    1. lay second piece of bread next to it so they can appreciate your beautiful work.

    In the case you don't have bread laying around, then pita is a **fantastic** alternative. Everything fits nicely in a toasted pita's pocket, and then it's all kept nicely inside while you eat it. 80% less messy than the bread version.
