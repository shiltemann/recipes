Yummie and easy!

Any combination of veggies will do, no need to do everything every time! Or add whatever other veggies you have lying around

If making multiple ones, put different combinations of components on each for variety! a fried egg also makes a very tasty topping!

Wheat tortillas (left) are bigger and softer, you can heat these in the microwave. Corn tortillas (right) are smaller and you can fry them in a dry pan (no oil or butter), until they get a bit crispy. They also come in blue corn variation which is fun.
