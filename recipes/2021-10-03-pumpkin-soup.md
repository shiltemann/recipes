  ingredients: |-
  - 800g pompoen
  - 400 mL stock
  - 200 mL kokosmelk
  - 1 tsp komijn (poeder)
  - 1 tsp kaneel
  - pompoenzaden
  - sour cream
  directions: |-
  1. Chop the **800g pompoen** so that they cook a bit faster, the cubes from appie are a bit too big. Throw them in the pot with a couple tsp of oil.
  2. Let these cook until soft. Add in **cajun spices** while cooking, perhaps some **red pepper flakes**. They should be quite tasty on their own when cooked.
  3. Put them in the blender and pulse for a few seconds, just to break up the big pieces. It should still be chunky!!
  4. Make the **400 mL stock**
  5. Add the stock + **200 mL kokosmelk** into the soup
  6. Return everything to the stove to warm up to temperature.
  7. Add a **1 tsp komijn** and **1 tsp kaneel**.
  8. Serve with **pompoenzaden** and maybe a drizzle of **sour cream** (agitate it until it's more liquidy.) Perhaps like 5 koriander leaves.
