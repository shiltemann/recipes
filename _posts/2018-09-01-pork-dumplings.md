recipe:
  servings: "60-70 dumplings"
  prep: 30 minutes
  cook: 60 minutes
  ingredients: |-
    * 1 package round dumpling/wonton/gyoza wrappers
    * 1 medium head nappa cabbage
    * 1 pound ground pork
    * 1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced
    * 1 bunch cilantro, minced 
    * 2 inch piece fresh ginger, finely grated
    * 2 tablespoons sesame oil
    * 3 tablespoons soy sauce
    * 1 tablespoon salt
    * 2 eggs, whisked
  Directions: |-
    **Prep**
    1. Slice the cabbage and mix with salt: Slice the half-head of cabbage down its length, through the root, to make 2 quarters. Then slice each quarter into very thin strips, cutting cross-wise. Toss the slices with the salt in a large mixing bowl and set aside for 5 to 10 minutes.
    2. Squeeze the liquid from the cabbage. While it rests with the salt, the cabbage will start to release liquid. When it's ready, grab handfuls of the cabbage and squeeze out the water. Transfer the squeezed cabbage to another mixing bowl.Combine the cabbage with the rest of the filling ingredients: To the bowl with the squeezed cabbage, add the ground pork, sliced scallions, cilantro, soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil, and eggs. Work the mixture together with your hands until fully combined.
    3. Combine the cabbage with the rest of the filling ingredients. To the bowl with the squeezed cabbage, add the ground pork, sliced scallions, cilantro, soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil, and eggs. Work the mixture together with your hands until fully combined.
    4. Arrange your dumpling-making station. Clear a large space on the counter. Set a small bowl of water, the bowl of filling, and a parchment-lined baking sheet nearby. Open the package of dumpling wrappers and arrange a few on the work space in front of you.
    5. Place 1 scant tablespoon of filling on each dumpling wrapper. It doesn't look like much filling, but using any more gets messy and makes the dumplings hard to pleat closed! Once you get the hang of pleating the dumplings, you can try adding a bit more.
    6. Dampen the edge of the wrapper with water. Dip your finger in the bowl of water and run it around the edge of the dumpling. This will help it to seal closed.
    7. Fold the dumpling in half. Lift the dumpling from the work surface and fold it in half. Press the top closed.
    8. Make a pleat in either side. Use your opposite thumbs to fold a tiny pleat on either side of the dumpling, then press firmly to seal the dumpling closed. You may need to dab a little water under the pleat to make it stick closed.
    9. Repeat with all the wrappers and filling. Continue filling and pleating the rest of the wrappers using the remaining filling — this is where having a few extra hands comes in handy! As you finish each dumpling, line it up on the parchment-lined baking sheet.
   
   **Cooking**
    1. Film a skillet with about a tablespoon of oil and warm over high heat. When the oil is shimmering, arrange the dumplings in the pan as close as they'll fit without actually touching. Cook until the bottoms have turned brown and golden.
    2. Pour 3 tablespoons of water in the pan — the water will immediately sizzle and begin to steam.
    3. Cover the pan immediately and reduce the heat to low. (If your skillet doesn't have a lid, cover with a baking sheet.)
    4. Cook the dumplings for 3 to 5 minutes if fresh, or 6 to 8 minutes if frozen. When done, the wrappers will appear translucent and noodle-like; the filling will be opaque and warmed through (you can cut one open to check).
    5. Transfer the cooked dumplings to a plate and serve with soy sauce or other dipping sauce.
